# `niv`

[`niv`][01] is a tool which helps manage the dependencies of [[154f93d5]]
projects by pinning package versions.

## Usage

Start with `niv init` in the project root. This creates the `nix/` directory,
containing `sources.{nix,json}`. The JSON file contains metadata about
dependencies, and the nix file can be used to import those dependencies in
other nix expressions:

```nix
{ sources ? import ./sources.nix }:     # import the sources
with
  { overlay = _: pkgs:
      { niv = import sources.niv {};    # use the sources :)
      };
  };
import sources.nixpkgs                  # and use them again!
  { overlays = [ overlay ] ; config = {}; }
```

The main benefit seems to be for adding dependencies which aren't
part of `nixpkgs`. For example, here's the example the README gives
for adding a package from GitHub:

```shell
$ niv add stedolan/jq
```

This will make the necessary updates to `nix/sources.json`.
