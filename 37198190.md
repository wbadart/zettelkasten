# `pipes`

`pipes` is a popular [[0f4cc4fe]] library for programming with data streams.
The library is structured around a small collection of categories which
formally describe various streaming behaviors.

`pipes`' value proposition is that it provides composable data streaming
components that support side effects ("effects, streaming, composability"),
while other solutions in the streaming domain only offer up to two of those.

> If you sacrifice _Effects_ you get Haskell's pure and lazy lists, which you
> can transform using composable functions in constant space, but without
> interleaving effects.
>
> If you sacrifice _Streaming_ you get `mapM`, `forM` and "`ListT` done wrong",
> which are composable and effectful, but do not return a single result until
> the whole list has first been processed and loaded into memory.
>
> If you sacrifice _Composability_ you write a tightly coupled read, transform,
> and write loop in IO, which is streaming and effectful, but is not modular or
> separable.

## Abstractions

`pipes` is based on a single internal abstraction (the [`Proxy`][proxy-docs]),
but from this derive four much more familiar abstractions:

- [Producers] (like generators),
- [Consumers] (like iteratees or sinks),
- [Pipes] (streaming transformations, like Unix pipes), and:
- [Effects] (programs)

[proxy-docs]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-4.3.16/docs/Pipes-Internal.html#t:Proxy
[Producers]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-4.3.16/docs/Pipes-Core.html#t:Producer
[Consumers]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-4.3.16/docs/Pipes-Core.html#t:Consumer
[Pipes]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-4.3.16/docs/Pipes-Core.html#t:Pipe
[Effects]: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-4.3.16/docs/Pipes-Core.html#t:Effect

A `Proxy` is like a box with an input, output, and result:

```text
    +---------+
    |         |
a  ==>       ==> b
    |    |    |
    +----|----+
         v
         r
```

You can "block off" input by specializing `a` to `()` (as is the case for
`Producer`s) and "block off" output by specializing `b` to `Void` (as is the case
for `Consumer`s). `Pipe`s of course have neither blocked off, and `Effect`s have
both.

### Producers

A `pipes` _producer_ is much like a Python generator; it uses a `yield` command
to send a datum to some unknown downstream consumer. Like with Python's
`yield`, when a producer yields, it suspends (blocks) until the yielded value
is consumed, at which point it resumes its execution.

`Producer`s are composed with the "into" operator, `(~>)`.

```haskell
(~>) :: Functor m => (a -> Producer b m r) -> (b -> Effect       m ()) -> (a -> Effect       m r)
(~>) :: Functor m => (a -> Producer b m r) -> (b -> Producer   c m ()) -> (a -> Producer   c m r)
(~>) :: Functor m => (a -> Pipe   x b m r) -> (b -> Consumer x   m ()) -> (a -> Consumer x   m r)
(~>) :: Functor m => (a -> Pipe   x b m r) -> (b -> Pipe     x c m ()) -> (a -> Pipe     x c m r)
```

`(~>)` is associative, and `yield` is both a left and right identity for it,
meaning that `Producer`s composed via the _into_ operator form a category: the
_generator category_.

### Consumers

A _consumer_ is like generator that uses sent values (but never `yield`s a
value itself, i.e. has a statement like `foo = yield`). In `pipes`, the `yield`
command is not overloaded in this way; `Consumer`s use the `await` command
(like a Python coroutine).

`Consumer`s are composed with the "feed" operator, `(>~)` (which is the dual of
`(~>)`.

```haskell
(>~) :: Functor m => Effect       m b -> Consumer b   m c -> Effect       m c
(>~) :: Functor m => Consumer a   m b -> Consumer b   m c -> Consumer a   m c
(>~) :: Functor m => Producer   y m b -> Pipe     b y m c -> Producer   y m c
(>~) :: Functor m => Pipe     a y m b -> Pipe     b y m c -> Pipe     a y m c
```

`(>~)` is associative, and `await` is both a left and right identity for it,
meaning that `Consumer`s composed via the _feed_ operator form a category: the
_iteratee category_.

### Pipes

A _pipe_ is both a consumer and a producer; it can both `yield` and `await`.
It's like a streaming function or data transformation.

`Pipe`s are composed with the "pipe" operator, `(>->)`.

```haskell
(>->) :: Functor m => Producer b m r -> Consumer b   m r -> Effect       m r
(>->) :: Functor m => Producer b m r -> Pipe     b c m r -> Producer   c m r
(>->) :: Functor m => Pipe   a b m r -> Consumer b   m r -> Consumer a   m r
(>->) :: Functor m => Pipe   a b m r -> Pipe     b c m r -> Pipe     a c m r
```

One example of a `Pipe` is `cat`, which re-forwards its input forever:

```haskell
cat :: Pipe a a m r
cat = forever $ await >>= yield
```

`(>->)` is associative, and `cat` is a left and right identity for it, meaning
that `Pipe`s composed via the _pipe_ operator form a category: the _category of
Unix pipes_.

### Effects

When a pipeline is complete, it will generally have a `Producer` on one end,
followed by zero or more `Pipe`s, and a `Consumer`. Because it starts with a
`Producer` and ends with a `Consumer`, the input and output are "blocked off"
(as described at the beginning of the section), leaving you with an `Effect`.
In `pipes`, the `runEffect` function lowers this to an `IO` action, to be
executed probably in `main`.
