# Hylomorphism

The composition of a [[234411dc]] and an [[4bb5719e]]. Hylomorphism models
general recursion (in contrast to [[8e03ceba]], which models primitive
recursion). In other words, hylomorphisms are [[065a02c9]].

[Tim Williams] posits that hylomorphisms allow us to replace any recursive
control structure with inductive data (which enables parallelism).
