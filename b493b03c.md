# Monoidal Category

A monoidal category is a category $\mathcal{C}$ equipped with some notion of
"tensor product" $\otimes$ and unit $1$. A tensor product is a [[9b360fa8]], or
more specifically in this case, a functor out of the product category of
$\mathcal{C}$ with itself:

$$
\otimes : \mathcal{C} \times \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{C}
$$

Together, the unit and tensor product must (unsurprisingly) follow the monoid
laws:

$$
(c_1 \otimes c_2) \otimes c_3 \simeq c_1 \otimes (c_2 \otimes c_3)
$$
$$
1 \otimes c \simeq c
$$
$$
c \otimes 1 \simeq c
$$

For a monoidal categories, these laws are witnessed by isomorphisms called the
"associator," "left unitor," and "right unitor" respectively.
