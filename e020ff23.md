# Confounding Bias

Confounding bias occurs in an experiment when a variable affects both who is
selected for a treatment and the outcome of the treatment.

Expressed in terms of a [[3894315b]]:

```{.graphviz}
digraph G {
  newrank=true
  C -> {X -> Y}
  subgraph cluster_vars {
    rank=same; peripheries=0
    X; Y
  }
}
```

Here, $C$ confounds the proposed causal relationship between $X$ and $Y$.

Note, measurements of $C$ can be used to deconfound the system by controlling
for it, measuring the treatment or control data stratified by value of $C$.
_Care must be taken to not end up controlling for what you're trying to
measure._

One way to eliminate confounding bias is the [[[0037250a]]]. Another way is by
conducting a randomized controlled trail (RCT). Both of these eliminate common
causes of the independent and observed variables (though the former only
eliminates arrows from confounders which were known and controlled for)

Non-causal conceptions of confounding can lead to problems. For example,

```{.graphviz}
digraph H {
  rankdir=LR
  X -> Z -> Y
}
```

Here, $Z$ is a _mediator_ of $X$'s effect on $Y$. Controlling for $Z$ would
eliminate the effect we're trying to measure.

```{.graphviz}
digraph I {
  rankdir=LR
  X -> M -> Y
  subgraph cluster0 {
    newrank=true; rank=same; peripheries=0
    M -> Z
  }
}
```

In this example, $Z$ is a _proxy_ for mediator $M$. Since $Z$ is not a perfect
measure of $M$, controlling for it doesn't perfectly eliminate $X$'s influence
on $Y$.
