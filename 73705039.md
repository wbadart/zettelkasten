# Bayesian Statistics

Bayesian statistics is a subfield of statistics which interprets probability as
a degree of belief, and which studies tools for updating those beliefs based on
new evidence. This is in contrast to [[d5086562]] (or simply "classical"
statistics), which interprets probability as the long-term frequency of an
event.

The practice of Bayesian statistics is based on [[[2dd4bb00]]].
