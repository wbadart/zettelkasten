# Cartesian Category

A cartesian (monoidal) category is a [[b493b03c]] whose monoidal structure is
given by the category-theoretic (cartesian) product (TODO: is this the same as
saying $\otimes = \times$?).

A cartesian category gives rise to "diagonal maps" $\Delta_x : x \to x \otimes
x$ and "augmentations" $e_x : x \to 1$. These can be interpreted as
"duplicating" data and "deleting" data, corresponding to the definition of
`Cartesian` from [[3bf32b3b]]:

```haskell
class Category k => Cartesian k where
  copy    :: k a (a, a)  -- diagonal map
  consume :: k a ()      -- augmentation
```
