# Probabilistic Programming

Probabilistic programs deal in [[ecfb7538]]s, rather than specific point
values, to model randomness and/ or uncertainty inherent to the processes they
describe.

> [U]nlike a traditional program, which only runs in the forward directions, a
> probabilistic program is run in both the forward and backward direction. It
> runs forward to compute the consequences of the assumptions it contains about
> the world (i.e., the model space it represents), but it also runs backward
> from the data to constrain the possible explanations. In practice, many
> probabilistic programming systems will cleverly interleave these forward and
> backward operations to efficiently home in on the best explanations.
