# Nix

Nix is a package manager and a programming language which describes
packages to the package manager.

Nix, both the package manager and the language, aim to be declarative
and functional to maximize reproducibility. The _derivation_ is the
central abstraction of the Nix system. A derivation (`.drv` file) is
a set of attributes _instantiated_ from a Nix expression
(`nix-instantiate`). To build and install a derivation (`nix-store
-r`) is to _realize_ it. See [Nix Pill 6][01].
