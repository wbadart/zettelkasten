# Combinator

A combinator is a pure function that only references its argument (i.e. doesn't
use anything from any external scope).

For example:

```haskell
sum xs = foldr (+) 0 xs
```

is not a combinator, since it references `foldr` and `(+)` (presumed to be
defined elsewhere) which are not arguments to `sum`. Meanwhile,

```haskell
compose f g x = g (f x)
```

is a combinator since it only uses its arguments, `f`, `g`, and `x`, not
referencing any name defined elsewhere.
