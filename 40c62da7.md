# APL

APL (["A Programming Language"][apl]) is an array programming language
conceived by Kenneth Iverson in the 1960s as a consistent mathematical
notation.

APL programs are comprised of strings of glyphs, each representing an array,
array operation, or modification to an array operation. These strings always
evaluate right to left (unless otherwise parenthesised), leading to a style
similar to chains of function compositions with `(.)` in [[0f4cc4fe]].

```apl
mean ← +/÷⍴
```

In the 1990s, Iverson and some of his associates developed [[[2a74c713]]] to
give an ASCII spelling to each glyph, and perhaps to shed some of the
historical baggage of APL.
