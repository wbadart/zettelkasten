# Ghosts of Departed Proofs

Ghosts of Departed Proofs (GDP) is an API design technique by encoding program
invariants in a type system. Specifically, proofs of invariants are encoded as
types inhabiting a phantom type parameter of a `newtype` parameter (so checking
them is a compile time task, i.e. it incurs no runtime cost).
