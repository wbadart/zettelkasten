# Event Storming

A facilitated workshop wherein developers, domain experts, project
stakeholders, and others

1. post [[bb56955b]]s on a wall with sticky notes
1. respond to posted event types with the business processes (workflows) they
   trigger
1. respond to posted workflows by noting the events they trigger in turn
1. etc.

It's a good exercise to stretch this out in both directions: ask "what comes
before the leftmost event on the wall? What comes after the rightmost?" This
line of questioning can reveal additional requirements.
