# How to Study Effectively, Paul Penn

## Space out study sessions

Evidence suggests studying a topic over the course of several shorter sessions
seems to improve retention, compared to just a couple longer sessions. Up to a
point, longer intervals between sessions can also improve retention.

## Interleave topics strategically

Studying a couple related topics together (rather than sequentially) can help
highlight the differences between those topics and improve your ability to
distinguish/ identify them. Sequential study of two topics tends to highlight
similarities (useful for topics that can already be readily distinguished).

## Construct your own understanding

Evidence suggests that memory is more reconstructive than reproductive in
nature; passively repeatedly re-reading a text builds familiarity with the
author's understanding but doesn't effectively advance one's own understanding.
Engaging the text, e.g. by asking questions while reading, helps build that
personal understanding.

## Practice information retrieval

Whether you can successfully recall a fact is a useful datum for calibrating
study (whether successful or not). Practicing retrieval tests your ability to
reconstruct your understanding of the topic.

One practice technique is "read, recite, review (3R)."

- **Read:** read a short segment of the source text
- **Recite:** try to reproduce the segment in your own words
- **Review:** see how closely your understanding matches the text. Repeat.

> You repeat these steps until you are satisfied with your ability to capture
> the meaning (not words) of the source material in question.

Overall, focus on actively engaging the text over passively consuming it. Ask
and answer questions of source material that focus on explanation ("why" and
"how" questions), consider other topics to study concurrently, and frequently
test comprehension.
