# J

J is an array programming language aimed at high-performance data analysis.

J descends from APL (both were developed by Kenneth Iverson, in the 90s and 60s
respectively), though where APL made heavy use of special graphical characters,
J sticks to ASCII.

J is designed to be like natural language, in a sense; programs are "sentences"
composed of "nouns" (data), "verbs" (functions), "adverbs" (verb modifiers),
and "conjunctions". The main noun (indeed, the only data-type in the language)
is the multidimensional array (which seems to be similar to/ have influenced
the Numpy `ndarray`).

An example J program for computing the mean of a vector (or of an array, along
a particular axis):

```j
mean =: +/ % #
```

This makes use of J's support for tacit/ point-free form.

An array's rank determines how a verb will act on it.
