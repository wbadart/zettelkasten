# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a popular, open-source container orchestration
framework, used to coordinate the running of containers and other
resources.

Many systems are implemented in terms of single-focus services (or
[microservices](TODO)) so that sophisticated behaviors can be
composed from those simpler components. [Containers](TODO) are one
attractive runtime for these services, as they allow the service and
its dependencies to be treated as a single unit. A container
orchestration framework like Kubernetes manages the lifecycle
(including scaling) of many such containers (thusly services) at
once, as well as auxiliary resources like storage volumes and
encrypted secrets.
