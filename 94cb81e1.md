# Parsing, Validation, & Serialization in Python

## Libraries

### [attrs](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/)

Eliminate much of the boilerplate involved in creating classes (from before
[`dataclasses`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) were
introduced).

```python
from attrs import define, Factory

@define
class SomeClass:
    a_number: int = 42
    list_of_numbers: list[int] = Factory(list)

    def hard_math(self, another_number):
        return self.a_number + sum(self.list_of_numbers) * another_number

>>> SomeClass(1, [1, 2, 3])
SomeClass(a_number=1, list_of_numbers=[1, 2, 3])
```

> On the tin, attrs might remind you of dataclasses (and indeed, dataclasses
> are a descendant of attrs). In practice it does a lot more and is more
> flexible. For instance it allows you to define [special handling of NumPy
> arrays for equality checks][np], or allows more ways to [plug into the
> initialization process][init].

### [cattrs](https://cattrs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html)

Library for converting between structured objects and unstructured
representations of those objects (e.g. for deserialization, use, and
serialization). Can leverage `attrs` metadata for advanced features.

### [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/)

Data modeling library with an emphasis on parsing. That is, instantiating a
pydantic model will make a best effort to transform the input data to the model
rather than throw an error. For example:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Foo(BaseModel):
    bar: int

>>> Foo(bar="10")
Foo(bar=10)
```

Here, `Foo` casts `"10"` to an `int`, rather than throw some sort of
validation/ type mismatch error.

### [marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

ORM framework for converting to and from native Python objects.

> - **Validate** input data.
> - **Deserialize** input data to app-level objects.
> - **Serialize** app-level objects to primitive Python types. The serialized
    objects can then be rendered to standard formats such as JSON for use in an
    HTTP API.

See also [marshmallow-dataclass][marsh dataclass].
