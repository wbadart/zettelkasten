# Zettelkasten

Zettelkasten is a non-linear note-taking technique that emphasizes the
connections between concepts and ideas.

I was led to Zettelkasten by a thread on either `haskell` or
`haskell-beginners` on the functional programming slack
(https://functionalprogramming.slack.com/). @srid had linked some _good first
issue_ issues on [`neuron`](https://github.com/srid/neuron). That led me to the
project's [homepage](https://neuron.srid.ca/) where I fell down the
Zettelkasten rabbit hole.
