# Apomorphism

A [recursion scheme](ded70ad5.md) modeling primitive corecursion over a
coinductive type; a short-circuitable unfold; an extension of [[4bb5719e]]; the
categorical [[8750ceb9]] dual to [[8e03ceba]]. From the Greek "[ἀπο]" for "away
from" (as in "apostasy").

[ἀπο]: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%80%CF%80%CF%8C

```haskell
apo f :: Functor f => RCoalgebra f a -> a -> Term f
apo f = In <<< fmap (id ||| apo f) <<< f
```

where

```haskell
type RCoalgebra f a = a -> f (Either (Fix f) a)
newtype Fix f = In { out :: f (Fix f) }
```

An R-coalgebra is like an F-coalgebra that can signal for termination by
returning a `Left` with a fixed functor (that functor becoming `apo`'s return
value). As expected, a `Right` will continue unfolding with the `a` inside.

TODO: example (see `insertElem` [as in insertion sort] from Williams' talk)
