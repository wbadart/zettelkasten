# Bayesian Inference

Bayesian inference leverages [[2dd4bb00]] to predict a value about some datum
of interest. Bayesian inference is about updating a prior belief to consider
new evidence or observations. Under Bayesian thinking, we interpret probability
as belief, so "updating a belief" amounts to updating an estimated probability.
This means that the output of Bayesian inference is not a single prediction,
but a probability distribution of outcomes (intrinsically capturing remaining
uncertainty).

Bayesian inference (and, more generally, statistical inference) tries to model
real-word events with [[ecfb7538]]s. The challenge is in estimating the true
parameters of the distribution describing the variable. The challenge is
compounded by the fact that only trivial events can be described by single
distributions, so accurate models must be comprised of systems of random
variables. Therefore, Bayesian inference is concerned with _beliefs_ about the
parameters to the relevant distributions.
