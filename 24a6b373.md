# Folds

Folds are [[997fa496]] that work like queries of a structure. Folds can focus
_many_ things (zero or more; compared to [[89c5b6c3]] which can only focus
exactly one thing) but can only _get_ the focus (not set/ update).

## Fold combinators

### Basics

```haskell
type Fold s a  -- No setting means no way to update structure means no polymorphism
folded :: Foldable f => Fold (f a) a
```

Note that since folds all focus zero or more things, `folded :: Fold (f a) [a]`
would be redundant.

```haskell
toListOf :: Fold s a -> s -> [a]
(^..)    :: s -> Fold s a -> [a]
(^..) = flip toListOf
```

`view`/`(^.)` play with folds in an interesting way; since lenses must focus
exactly one thing, but folds focus zero or more, `view`ing a fold requires that
the focus be a monoid, so that focusing zero things can return `mempty` and
focusing many things can be combined using `(<>)`. (Explicit `foldOf`
recommended.)

```haskell
>>> let path = folded . _2
>>> let xs = [(1, "one"), (2, "two")]
>>> let empty = [] :: [(Int, String)]

>>> xs ^.. path  -- recall: (^..) = flip toListOf
["one", "two"]
>>> xs ^. path
"onetwo"  -- "one" <> "two"
>>> foldOf path xs
"onetwo"
>>> empty ^.. path
[]
>>> empty ^. path
""  -- mempty
>>> foldOf path empty
""
```

Also note that lenses can be used as folds; lenses focus exactly one thing,
which fits in the range of zero or more things focused by a lens:

```haskell
>>> (1, "one") ^.. _2
["one"]
```

### Misc

```haskell
both :: Bitraversable r => Fold (r a a) a
>>> ("foo", "bar") ^.. both
["foo", "bar"]
>>> Right 10 ^.. both
[10]

-- Like `folded` when the `Foldable` instance touches every element.
each :: Each s s a a => Fold s a
>>> (1, 2, 3) ^.. each
[1, 2, 3]
```

(`both` and `each` are actually [[97854b7b]], which can evidently specialize to
a fold.)

```haskell
-- like the `lens` helper but for constructing Folds rather than Lenses
folding :: Foldable f => (s -> f a) -> Fold s a
```

`folding` takes a projection function that specifies how to fold `s`, e.g.:

```haskell
>>> let foo = M.fromList [(1, "one"), (2, "two")]
>>> foo ^.. folded
["one","two"]
>>> foo ^.. folding M.keys
[1,2]
```

```haskell
-- Used to map over the end of the fold
-- also more general, but here it is specialized to folds:
to :: (s -> a) -> Fold s a
```

`to` is a `Getter`; a 1-to-1 mapping (get half of a [[89c5b6c3]]), so it never
fails and can always transform input to output.

```haskell
newtype Temp = Temp { getTemp :: Float }

>>> [Temp 10, Temp 20] ^.. each . to getTemp
[10.0,20.0]
```

## Fold actions

```haskell
-- More simplified types:
sumOf       :: Num a => Fold s a                         -> s -> a
productOf   :: Num a => Fold s a                         -> s -> a
elemOf      :: Eq a  => Fold s a -> a                    -> s -> Bool
anyOf       ::          Fold s a -> (a -> Bool)          -> s -> Bool
allOf       ::          Fold s a -> (a -> Bool)          -> s -> Bool
-- first match
findOf      ::          Fold s a -> (a -> Bool)          -> s -> Maybe a
-- aka "not.{null,empty}"
has         ::          Fold s a                         -> s -> Bool
lengthOf    ::          Fold s a                         -> s -> Int
-- same as preview, flip (^?)
firstOf     ::          Fold s a                         -> s -> Maybe a
preview     ::          Fold s a                         -> s -> Maybe a
lastOf      ::          Fold s a                         -> s -> Maybe a
minimumOf   :: Ord a => Fold s a                         -> s -> Maybe a
maximumOf   :: Ord a => Fold s a                         -> s -> Maybe a
minimumByOf ::          Fold s a -> (a -> a -> Ordering) -> s -> Maybe a
maximumByOf ::          Fold s a -> (a -> a -> Ordering) -> s -> Maybe a
```

Can be helpful to define

```haskell
import Data.Ord ( comparing )

comparingOf :: Ord a => Lens' s a -> s -> s -> Ordering
comparingOf l = comparing (view l)
```

To help in cases like `minimumByOf`/ `maximumByOf` (can convert a lens into the
comparator function).

### Effectful folds

```haskell
traverseOf_ :: Functor f => Fold s a -> (a -> f r) -> s -> f ()
forOf_      :: Functor f => Fold s a -> s -> (a -> f r) -> f ()
```

### Combining fold results

All fold actions are powered by monoids, and these actions start to expose some
of that underlying power:

```haskell
foldOf      :: Monoid m => Fold s m             -> s -> m
foldMapOf   :: Monoid m => Fold s a -> (a -> m) -> s -> m
```

`foldMapByOf` basically lets you construct a monoid instance on the fly by
taking the combining function and the unit value as arguments:

```haskell
foldMapByOf :: Fold s a -> (r -> r -> r) -> r -> (a -> r) -> s -> r
```

## Higher-order folds

```haskell
taking        :: Int         -> Fold s a -> Fold s a
dropping      :: Int         -> Fold s a -> Fold s a
takingWhile   :: (a -> Bool) -> Fold s a -> Fold s a
droppingWhile :: (a -> Bool) -> Fold s a -> Fold s a

backwards :: Fold s a -> Fold s a

-- $$$
filtered   :: (s -> Bool) -> Fold s s
filteredBy :: Fold s a    -> Fold s s
```

`filteredBy` is useful in combination with

```haskell
only :: Eq a => a -> Fold a ()
```
