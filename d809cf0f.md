# Ladder of Causation

The Ladder of Causation is a system of classifying causal reasoning activities.

The Ladder has three "rungs," described in Judea Pearl's _The Book of Why_ (in
"ascending" order): association, intervention, and counterfactuals.

## Association

Association is about passive observation, asking questions about concurrence or
correlation ("how likely is a customer who bought toothpaste to buy floss?");
questions that might be answered by conditional probability (see [[2dd4bb00]]).

## Intervention

Intervention begins to ask questions that cannot be answered by observation
alone, e.g. "what will happen to floss sales if we double the price of
toothpaste?" Methods from the Association rung are insufficient since for any
past data about toothpaste at that price-point, there are background factors
unaccounted for (e.g. shortage caused price hike for the whole region). It
would require an experiment, a host of other data (with Association-level
techniques), or a causal model (with Intervention-level techniques) to answer
the original question.

## Counterfactuals

"What would have happened if $X$?" (e.g. "would I still have the headache if I
_had_ taken the aspirin?")
