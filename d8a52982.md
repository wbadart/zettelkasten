# Homomorphism

A homomorphism is a function between (the underlying sets of) two algebras that
preserves the algebraic structure.

$$
\phi : A \to B
$$

st.

$$
\phi(a_1 \cdot a_2) = \phi(a_1) \cdot \phi(a_2)
$$

That is to say: if you combine $a_1$ and $a_2$ (in algebra $A$) then apply the
homomorphism $\phi$, you'll get the same result as applying $\phi$ to $a_1$ and
$a_2$ individually, then combining the results (in algebra $B$).

There is a notion of class-specific homomorphisms, e.g. "[[ae29cf31]]
homomorphism," "semigroup homomorphism," "monoid homomorphism." It seems that
for $\phi$ to be a valid _X_ homomorphism, it must preserve _X_'s laws in some
way. For example, the above definition is sufficient for magmas and semigroups,
but not for monoids; $\phi$ must preserve identities to be a monoid
homomorphism:

$$
\phi(1_A) = 1_B
$$
