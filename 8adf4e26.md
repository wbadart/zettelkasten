# `lorri`

`lorri` is a tool for managing development environments using [[154f93d5]] and
[`direnv`][01].

Nix includes a tool called `nix-shell` which drops the user into a
shell environment with the packages and environment specified by a
particular Nix expression (loaded from `./shell.nix` by default).
lorri enhances this workflow by

1. Being faster
2. Integrating with `direnv` to automatically load the configuration
   when the project directory is entered
3. Editor integrations

## Usage

With lorri installed (e.g. `nix-env -i lorri`), start the daemon,
either by running `lorri daemon` in a background window somewhere or
by following the service [setup instructions][02] for your system.

To start managing a project, run `lorri init` in the root. This will
create a `.envrc` file for `direnv` to pick up and a `shell.nix` file
which defines the development environment. Run `lorri shell` to build
the environment.
