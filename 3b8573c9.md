# Zygomorphism

A [recursion scheme](ded70ad5.md) that tears down a structure using two
F-algebras: an auxiliary "helper" algebra, and a "main" algebra that consumes
both the intermediate recursion result (as usual) and the output of the helper.

```haskell
zygo :: Functor f => FAlgebra f aux -> Helped f r aux -> Fix f -> r
zygo helper main = fst . cata (alg helper main)
 where
 alg :: Functor f => FAlgebra f aux -> Helped f r aux -> FAlgebra f (r, aux)
 alg helper main = main &&& helper . fmap snd
```

where

```haskell
type FAlgebra f a = f a -> a
type Helped f r aux = f (r, aux) -> r  -- `FAlgebra f r` helped by `aux`
newtype Fix f = In { out :: f (Fix f) }
```

For example, you might use an AST evaluation F-algebra as the helper for
another algebra that computes a particular metric about the program being
evaluated. This other algebra would be able to see the evaluated value of the
current term and current intermediate results.
