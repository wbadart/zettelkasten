# Causal Diagram Junctions

A junction in a [[3894315b]] is a pattern of edges that affect how information
would flow through the diagram.

## Chain

```{.graphviz}
digraph Chain {
  rankdir=LR
  A -> B -> C
}
```

Here, $B$ is a mechanism, or _mediating variable_, a la _Fire -> Smoke ->
Alarm_. The fire by itself doesn't set off the alarm, the alarm is only
triggered when it detects smoke particles created by the fire. No smoke (e.g.
fume hood), no alarm, even if fire.

This means $B$ "screens off" information between $A$ and $C$. Once we know
smoke, learning about fire should not affect our belief in alarm.

## Fork

```{.graphviz}
digraph Fork {
  B -> A
  B -> C
}
```

$B$ is a _common cause_ or _confounder_ of $A$ and $C$; it makes $A$ and $C$
statistically correlated, even though there's no direct causal link between
them. For example, _Show Size <- Child's Age -> Reading Level_; children with
larger shoes read better, but it's because they're older, not because they have
large feet. We can eliminate this spurious effect by controlling for age.

## Collider

```{.graphviz}
digraph Collider {
  A -> B
  C -> B
}
```

$A$ and $C$, which are otherwise unrelated, both contribute to $B$. For
example, _Talent -> Celebrity <- Beauty_. Controlling for $B$ makes $A$ and $C$
appear correlated; looking only at very famous actors, observing _beauty_
lowers our belief in _talent_, due to the "explain away" effect.
