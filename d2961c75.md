# GraphQL

GraphQL is a ["query language for your API"][home]. GraphQL describes an API in
terms of (nested) schemas which relate to a system of "resolvers" (server-side
functions that read and operate on application data). By tying the interface to
code, rather than a particular storage system, GraphQL APIs can use any number
of databases (including 0), making them suitable for integrating other backend
systems into one API.

Calls to a GraphQL API are either a "query" (read) or a "mutation" (write/
update). (The contract that queries are read-only is the basis for aggressive
caching in GraphQL client libraries.)

There is a "root resolver" for queries called `Query` which all other resolvers
branch off of. For example:

```graphql
type Query {
    greeting: String!  # non-null string
    you: User
}

type User {
    name: String!
    age: Int
}
```

The resolvers allow queries to specify which fields they'd like to receive
(while the reverse is typically true in traditional REST systems). For
instance the response to the query:

```graphql
{
    you {
        age
    }
}
```

will only include `you`'s `age` field.

An overview of GraphQL's types can be found in the [manual].
