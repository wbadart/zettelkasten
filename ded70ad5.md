# Recursion Schemes

Recursion schemes generalize various modes of tearing down or building up
recursive #data-structures, allowing programmers to specify the "meat" of a
recursive function separately from the mechanical specifics of recursing.

| Name | Characterization | Takes
|------|------------------|------
| [[[234411dc]]] | `foldr` | F-algebra: `f a -> a`
| [[[4bb5719e]]] | `unfoldr` | F-coalgebra: `a -> f a`
| [[[8e03ceba]]] | primitive recursion | R-algebra: `f (Fix f, a) -> a`
| [[[b48c52f0]]] | primitive corecursion (terminable unfold) | R-coalgebra: `a -> f (Fix f \| a)`
| [[[3b8573c9]]] | fold with helper algebra | two F-algebras (one taking helper data)
| [[[c5c9b27a]]] | produce then consume | an F-coalgebra and an F-algebra
| [[[59fc6bcf]]] | history-preserving fold | CV-algebra: `f (Attr f a) -> a`
| futumorphism | forward-info-passing unfold | CV-coalgebra: `a -> f (CoAttr f a)`
| (chronomorphism) | produce then consume (w/ extra capability) | a CV-coalgebra and a CV-algebra

where

```haskell
newtype Fix f = In { out :: f (Fix f) }

data Attr f a = Attr
  { attribute :: a
  , hole      :: f (Attr f a)
  }

data Coattr f a
  = Automatic a
  | Manual (f (CoAttr f a))
```

Williams]' talk.

    the now-common category-theoretic formulation

    recovered by instantiating the general pattern at a particular comonad
