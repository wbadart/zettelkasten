# Category

A category is a collection of objects and (directed) connections between those
objects. By definition, every object is connected to itself (identity). Also,
if object $A$ connects to $B$ and $B$ to $C$, then $A$ can be said to connect
to $C$ (composition).

Since the objects in a category are totally opaque, _category theory_
is necessarily the study of the structures formed by the relationships between
the objects of a category. This calls to mind the [Yoneda
perspective](e311d3de.md):
