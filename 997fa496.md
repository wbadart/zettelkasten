# Optics

"Optics" describes a family of interoperable tools for building bidirectional
data transformations. The most popular of these tools are, in general, of one
of the following subfamilies:

- [[[89c5b6c3]]]
- [[[24a6b373]]]
- [[[97854b7b]]]
- [[[3ffafe67]]]
- [[[ea645340]]]

Each of these kinds of optics provides a different balance of constraint vs.
flexibility (e.g. lenses are less flexible and more constrained, so we have
more guarantees about their behavior, but there are fewer of them).

Optics can concisely express solutions to many different data manipulation
problems. This expressive power comes in large part from their breadth and
composability; there is a huge variety of different optics, and more
importantly, many unique ways to compose them.

Optics also separate the _access_ of data from the _action_ on data (see
[[[89c5b6c3]]] for concrete examples).
