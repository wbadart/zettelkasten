# Extensible Records

If a record is taken to be something like the schema of a (tagged?)
product type, then an extensible record is a record which can have
its fields manipulated, yielding new record types.

In [[0f4cc4fe]], records are commonly represented as product types:

```haskell
data Person = Person
  { name :: String
  , age :: Int
  }
```

However, these types aren't easy to manipulate. This difficulty, combined with
other drawbacks, comprise "the [record problem]" in Haskell. Some proposed
solutions include:

- the [`vinyl`][vinyl] package
- the (less-popular) [`record`][record] package
- possible [language updates]
