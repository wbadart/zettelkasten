# HLearn

HLearn is an open-source research project investigating performant, flexible
machine learning APIs in [[0f4cc4fe]].

The "H" stands for 3 different important aspects of the project:

1. Haskell: "Machine learning is about estimating functions from data, so it
   makes sense that a functional programming language would be well suited for
   machine learning."

1. Homomorphisms: HLearn explores what different classes of algebraic objects
   imply in the context of machine learning. For example, if data frame rows/
   chunks form a monoid, then you get parallel batch training.

1. The History Monad: an innovative approach to debugging the optimization
   procedure with no runtime overhead.
