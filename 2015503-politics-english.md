[_Politics and the English Language_][01] is a 1946 essay by George
Orwell about some bad writing habits he felt were infecting English
language.

Orwell believed that lazy writing creates a vicious cycle that
degrades the language over time:

> [The English language] becomes ugly and inaccurate because our
thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it
easier for us to have foolish thoughts.

Luckily, the process, he believed, is reversible if everyone (not
just professionals) undertake more careful writing.

- **dying metaphors**: fresh metaphors are evocative, and some old
  ones are basically ordinary language at this point. "But in
  between... there is a huge dump of worn-out metaphors which have
  lost all evocative power and are merely used because they save
  people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves."
- **operators/ verbal false limbs**: turns verbs into noun/ verb
  phrases, e.g. break -> render inoperative. He includes some passive
  voice here, e.g. justify -> have grounds given for.
  - _not un-_ formations ("not unheard of")
  - simple prepositions replaced by phrases, e.g. "with respect to"/
    "having regard to"
- **pretentious diction**: just what it sounds like
  - also discourages unneeded foreign words
  - includes Latin/ Greek words where there already exists a Saxon
    word (calls out political and scientific writers)
- **meaningless words**: "The outstanding features of Mr X's work is
  its living quality." Can include overloaded words, e.g. "Fascism"
  -> generally undesirable.
  
Writing in this style is akin to stringing together pre-fab phrases
and "making the results presentable by sheer humbug... If you use
ready-made phrases, you... don't have to hunt about for words."

> The great enemy of clear language is insincerity.

> We think of concrete things wordlessly... When you think of
something abstract your are more inclined to use words from the
start... Probably it is better to put off using words as long as
possible and get one's meaning as clear as one can through pictures
or sensations. Afterwards one can choose -- not simply _accept_ --
the phrases that will best cover the meaning.

Orwell gives the following rules to fall back on when in doubt:

1. Don't use over-used metaphors
2. Never use a long word where a short one will do
3. If it is possible to cut out a word, cut it out
4. Prefer active to passive
5. Prefer everyday language to jargon
6. "Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright
   barbarous."
