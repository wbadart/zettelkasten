# Counterfactual Fairness

Counterfactual fairness (CF) is a test of fairness for a given predictor. It is
based on [[c94192d6]].

CF captures an intuition that a decision is fair (with respect to some
property) if it would have still been the same if the attribute had been
different (e.g. "the insurance price is fair [wrt. age] because it would have
been the same if the policy holder was over age 60").

The metric uses Pearl's _interventions_ to estimate (right word?) the
probability of the predictor giving the same result ($y$) for a different value
of a particular attribute (observed $a$ vs. counterfactual/ hypothetical $a'$).

$$
P(\hat{Y}_{A{\leftarrow}a}(U)=y|X=x,A=a) = P(\hat{Y}_{A{\leftarrow}a'}(U)=y|X=x,A=a)
$$
