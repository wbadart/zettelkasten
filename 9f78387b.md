# Relude

Relude is an alternative standard library (Prelude) for [[0f4cc4fe]].

[Haskell](TODO)'s Prelude is a module automatically imported into all
other modules unless otherwise specified (e.g. by the
`NoImplicitPrelude` GHC extension). Relude re-implements many of
these standard tools to address shortcomings in safety, performance,
and completeness.
