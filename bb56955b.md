# Domain Event

The starting point or trigger of a business process in a [DDD](604a437f.md)
model.

Some examples of Domain Events are real world events (e.g. customer submitted a
new order) timers (e.g. run this every Tuesday at 12pm) and observations
("inbox empty"). They are often phrased in past tense since, from the point of
view of the workflows they trigger, they will always be in the past.

[[[708bbc66]]] is a popular way to bring cross-functional, cross-domain teams
together to discover a domain in terms of its events.

Domain Events sometimes trigger [[[45deffdd]]], which are requests for a
particular action. This is the general model for a business process: an event
("order form received") triggers a command ("place order") triggers a workflow,
which may trigger further events.
