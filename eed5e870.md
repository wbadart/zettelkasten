# Blackbird

The blackbird is a combinator which is the composition of composition with
composition:

```haskell
blackbird :: (b -> c) -> (a1 -> a2 -> b) -> a1 -> a2 -> c
blackbird = (.) . (.)
```

More helpfully, the blackbird composes a function of one argument with a
function of two, creating a pipeline with two inputs and one output:

```haskell
> quotientPlusOne = blackbird (+1) (/)
> quotientPlusOne 10 2
6.0
```
