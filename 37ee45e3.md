# Operator Fixity

[[0f4cc4fe]] has a notion of _operator fixity_, which determines how tightly an
infix operator binds to its arguments. Fixity ranges from 0 to 9 (inclusive).
Low fixity means low binding priority (e.g. `($)` has fixity 0 so all other
operators are applied before it), and high fixity means high binding priority
(e.g. `(.)` has fixity 9 so composition is applied before anything else).

When setting the fixity of an operator, you also define whether it associates
left or right: `infixl n` vs `infixr n` (where `n` is the fixity priority).
