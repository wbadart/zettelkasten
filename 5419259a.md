# TLS

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol which
provides security, privacy, and integrity checking to network
communications.

It's the successor of the (now-deprecated) Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
protocol.

TLS communications are encrypted by symmetric cryptography. The keys
for this encryption are uniquely generated for each connections. The
connection starts with a "handshake" phase before any real data is
transmitted. During this phase, the parameters of encryption are
negotiated (based in part on what algorithms and options the client
and server each support) and the keys generated (e.g. via
Diffie-Hellman). The handshake is secured with an asymmetric cipher.

The identity of either party can be verified ("authenticated") with public-key
(asymmetric) cryptography. In general, at least one party must prove its
identity, typically the server. The server does so by presenting a certificate
with its name, public key, and the [Certificate Authority (CA)](43f8852b.md)
which vouches for the authenticity of the certificate (specifically, the CA
certifies ownership of the public key).
