# Anamorphism

A [recursion scheme](ded70ad5.md) that builds up a recursive structure from a
seed (corecursion). From the Greek "[ἀνά][wiktionary]" for "building" (e.g.
"anabolic"), "up", or "upon".

[wiktionary]: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%80%CE%BD%CE%AC

```haskell
ana :: (Functor f) => FCoalgebra f a -> a -> Fix f
ana f = In <<< fmap (ana f) <<< f
```

where

```haskell
type FCoalgebra f a = a -> f a
newtype Fix f = In { out :: f (Fix f) }
```

Anamorphisms are the categorical [[8750ceb9]] of [[234411dc]]s, and they work
with F-coalgebras, the dual of an F-algebra.

For example, given:

```haskell
data List a f
  = Cons a f
  | Nil
  deriving Functor
```

we can write:

```haskell
replicate :: forall a. Int -> a -> Fix (List a)
replicate n a = ana go n where
  go :: FCoalgebra (List a) Int
  go 0 = Nil
  go n = Cons a (n - 1)

main = print $ len (replicate 10 'a')  -- "10"
 where len = cata \case
         Nil -> 0
         Cons _ rest -> 1 + rest
```
