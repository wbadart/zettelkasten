# Back-Door Criterion

The back-door criterion is a heuristic for evaluating which variables in a
[[3894315b]] are _deconfounders_ (used to counter [[e020ff23]]).

To deconfound $X$ and $Y$, we must block every non-causal path between them in
a [[3894315b]], while leaving any causal paths alone. A _back-door path_ is any
path from $X$ to $Y$ beginning with an arrow into $X$. Blocking all such paths
prevents spurious correlation between $X$ and $Y$.

We must also ensure that no controlled-for variable is a descendant of $X$ on a
causal path, which would block the effect we're trying to measure.
