# Domain-Driven Design

An approach to software design focused on clear communication and shared domain
knowledge.

Traditionally, business problems are translated into requirements, are
translated into architecture, are translated into code, with each translation
introducing further opportunities for error. DDD practitioners, by contrast,
norm around a single mental model of the domain which is created
collaboratively by domain experts and developers, and is shared by them and by
the source code itself. This eliminates as much translation as possible.

To create a shared model:

- Focus on business events ([[[bb56955b]]]) and workflows over data structures
- Partition out subdomains each with its own model
- Develop a [[[529456cf]]] that is shared by all teams and code
