# Causal Diagram

A causal diagram is a directed graph which models known or assumed cause/
effect relationships between events, where $a{\rightarrow}b$ means "$a$ causes
$b$."

For a morbid example lifted from _The Book of Why_, "because she receives the
court order, the captain orders the firing squad (soldiers A and B) to fire,
causing the prisoner to die."

```{.graphviz}
digraph G {
  "Court Order (CO)" -> "Captain (C)" -> {"Soldier A (A)","Soldier B (B)"} -> "Death (D)"
}
```

With this model, we can answer questions at rung one of the [[d809cf0f]], such
as "if we see A shoot, do we expect B to have shot?" (_Yes_, because we can see
that $A$ is caused by $C$, so if we observe $A$, then we know $C$. But $C$ also
causes $B$, so, because $C$ we may infer $B$.)

Basic manipulations of the graph can answer questions at the second rung, such
as "would the prisoner have died if soldier A had fired without being ordered?"
The procedure to intervene and "make" an event happen is simply to remove all
arrows coming into it and proceeding as usual.

```{.graphviz}
digraph H {
  "A = True" -> D
  CO -> C -> B -> D
}
```

$A$ is true, and is a cause of $D$, so we confirm that the prisoner would still
die in this scenario. Note that we can no longer infer $B$ from $A$, as we
could before the modification, since nothing about $A$ leads to $B$.

Finally, the model can be used to answer counterfactual questions at rung
three, e.g. if A decided not to shoot, would the prisoner be alive?

```{.graphviz}
digraph I {
  "A = False" -> D
  "CO = True" -> "C = True" -> "B = True" -> D
}
```

We infer _yes_, the prisoner would still be dead, because B still would have
shot him. This is an example of [[c94192d6]].

There are a few types of [[[c7943d9d]]] which affect how information flows
through a causal diagram.
